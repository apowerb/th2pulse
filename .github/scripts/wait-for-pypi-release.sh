# Waits until installing a specific PyPI package version resolves, instead
# of guessing a fixed sleep.
#
# Why this exists: the Docker publish workflow runs on workflow_run of the
# PyPI publish workflow completing, then the Dockerfile immediately runs
# `uv pip install --system --no-cache-dir "th2pulse==$VERSION"`. PyPI's
# index takes some time to propagate a freshly published release, so
# building right away is a race. Releases 0.1.11 and 0.1.12 both failed the
# Docker build with:
#
#   Because there is no version of th2pulse==X and you require
#   th2pulse==X, we can conclude that your requirements are unsatisfiable.
#
# and both succeeded on manual re-run once PyPI had caught up.
#
# This script runs the exact same class of command the Dockerfile runs
# (`uv pip install --dry-run --system`), so it fails and succeeds under the
# same condition as the real build - it is not a proxy for it. An earlier
# version polled PyPI's JSON metadata endpoint (/pypi/<name>/<version>/json)
# instead; that endpoint is a different code path from the Simple index the
# resolver actually reads, and can report "available" before the resolver
# agrees - which would pass this step while the real Docker build still
# fails. `--dry-run` performs full dependency resolution without installing
# or downloading anything.
#
# Required env vars:
#   PACKAGE_NAME     - PyPI project name, e.g. th2pulse
#   PACKAGE_VERSION  - exact release version to wait for, e.g. 0.1.12
# Optional env vars:
#   MAX_ATTEMPTS     - default 90
#   SLEEP_SECONDS    - default 10
#   EXTRA_UV_ARGS    - extra space-separated arguments forwarded to
#                      `uv pip install` (tests use this to point uv at a
#                      local package source instead of the real PyPI index)

# the same day. Propagation time is not a constant, so the budget is sized for
# the slow case rather than the median.

# A wide budget costs nothing when propagation is quick -- the loop exits on
# the first successful resolution, it does not wait out its allowance.
